# re-Terminal

## Welcome to Hugo Theme re-Terminal!

Hello! I'm thrilled to announce a brand new fork of Hugo Theme Terminal, now officially known as Hugo Theme Re-Terminal!

As the maintainer, I'm excited to share that this theme will continue to evolve and receive updates with new features. Why? Because I use it myself! You can bet your last byte that any changes I make will be thoroughly tested and refined for real-world use.

This fork aims to breathe new life into the original Terminal theme, which was once a popular choice among Hugo enthusiasts. Unfortunately, it had been neglected over time. But no more! With re-Terminal, we're committed to keeping the spirit of the original alive while adding fresh perspectives and innovations.

So, welcome aboard! I'm excited to have you join us on this journey as we shape the future of Hugo Theme re-Terminal together. Let's get started!

### DEMO - https://mtwb.blog

### ⚠️ The theme needs at least Hugo **Extended** v0.128.0.

re-Terminal before v2.1.0 may work with versions of HUGO less than v0.128.0 below to v0.90.0 if you change the min version manually in mod files, but I didn't test it

  :root {
    --accent: #23B0FF; /* 1 of 5 basic colors */
    --background: color-mix(in srgb, var(--accent) 2%, #1D1E28 98%); /* background color; inherit shades of the accent */
    --accent-contrast-color: black; /* mainly uses for text on the accent backgrounds but not limited */
    --color: white; /* text color, also some other text use the variable in color mixing */
    --border-color: rgba(255, 255, 255, .1); /* border color */
    --article-link-color: var(inherit); /* for you, who want to colorize your article links */
    --menu-color: black; /* a variable for menus color */

    /* code syntax */
    /* take a look at themes/re-terminal/assets/css/syntax.scss to understand in detail which color stands for */
    --syntax-func-color: color-mix(in srgb, var(--accent) 70%, #999 30%);
    --syntax-var-color: color-mix(in srgb, var(--accent) 90%, transparent);
    --syntax-value-color: color-mix(in srgb, var(--accent), white);

    /* breakpoints */

## How to start

You can download the theme manually by going to [https://github.com/mirus-ua/hugo-theme-re-terminal.git](https://github.com/mirus-ua/hugo-theme-re-terminal.git) and pasting it to `themes/re-terminal` in your root directory.

You can also choose **one of the 3 possibilities** to install the theme:

1. as Hugo Module
2. as a standalone local directory
3. as a git submodule

⚠️ The theme needs at least Hugo **Extended** v0.128.x.

### Install theme as Hugo Module

```bash
# If this is the first time you're using Hugo Modules
# in your project. You have to initiate your own module before
# you fetch the theme module.
#
# hugo mod init [your website/module name]
hugo mod get github.com/mirus-ua/hugo-theme-re-terminal
```

and in your config file add:

```toml
[module]
  # this is needed when you fetch the theme as a submodule to your repo.
  # replacements = "github.com/mirus-ua/hugo-theme-re-terminal -> themes/re-terminal"
[[module.imports]]
  path = 'github.com/mirus-ua/hugo-theme-re-terminal'
```

Keep in mind that the theme by default won't show up in the `themes` directory. This means that you are using the theme as it was on the repository at the moment you fetched it. Your local `go.sum` file keeps all the references. Read more about Hugo Modules in the [official documentation](https://gohugo.io/hugo-modules/).

### Install theme locally

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mirus-ua/hugo-theme-re-terminal.git themes/re-terminal
```

This will clone the repository directly to the `themes/re-terminal` directory.

### Install theme as a submodule

```bash
git submodule add -f https://github.com/mirus-ua/hugo-theme-re-terminal.git themes/re-terminal
```

This will install the repository as a sumbodule in the `themes/re-terminal` directory.

⚠️ If you encounter any issues with:

```bash
Error: module "re-terminal" not found; either add it as a Hugo Module or store it in "[...your custom path]/themes".: module does not exist
```

then please try to remove `theme = "re-terminal"` from your config file.

## How to run your site

```bash
hugo server -t re-terminal
```

and go to `localhost:1313` in your browser. From now on all the changes you make will go live, so you don't need to refresh your browser every single time.

## How to configure

The theme doesn't require any advanced configuration. Just copy:

```toml
baseurl = "/"
languageCode = "en-us"
# Add it only if you keep the theme in the `themes` directory.
# Remove it if you use the theme as a remote Hugo Module.
theme = "re-terminal"
pagination.pagerSize = 5

[params]
  # dir name of your main content (default is `content/posts`).
  # the list of set content will show up on your index page (baseurl).
  contentTypeName = "posts"

  # ["orange", "blue", "red", "green", "pink", "paper"]
  themeColor = "orange"

  # if you set this to 0, only submenu trigger will be visible
  showMenuItems = 2

  # show selector to switch language
  showLanguageSelector = false

  # set theme to full screen width
  fullWidthTheme = false

  # center theme with default width
  centerTheme = false

  # if your resource directory contains an image called `cover.(jpg|png|webp)`,
  # then the file will be used as a cover automatically.
  # With this option you don't have to put the `cover` param in a front-matter.
  autoCover = true

  # set post to show the last updated
  # If you use git, you can set `enableGitInfo` to `true` and then post will automatically get the last updated
  showLastUpdated = false

  # set a custom favicon (default is a `themeColor` square)
  # favicon = "favicon.ico"

  # Provide a string as a prefix for the last update date. By default, it looks like this: 2020-xx-xx [Updated: 2020-xx-xx] :: Author
  # updatedDatePrefix = "Updated"

  # set all headings to their default size (depending on browser settings)
  # oneHeadingSize = true # default

  # whether to show a page's estimated reading time
  # readingTime = false # default

  # whether to show a table of contents
  # can be overridden in a page's front-matter
  # Toc = false # default

  # set title for the table of contents
  # can be overridden in a page's front-matter
  # TocTitle = "Table of Contents" # default

  # you can set a banner on the top of the page with a call to action
  # defaults: dismissible = false; URL is optional
  # [params.banner]
  # dismissible = false

[[module.imports]]
  path = 'github.com/mirus-ua/hugo-theme-re-terminal'
```

to `config.toml` file in your Hugo root directory and change params fields. In case you need, here's [a YAML version](https://gist.github.com/panr/9eeea6f595c257febdadc11763e3a6d1).

**NOTE:** Please keep in mind that `main menu` supports submenu nesting (since v2.1.0).

## Post archetype

See the default `post` file params supported by the theme — https://github.com/mirus-ua/hugo-theme-re-terminal/blob/main/archetypes/posts.md

## How to edit the theme `<a id="how-to-edit" />`

If you are using as a remote Hugo Module (you don't have the theme files in the `theme/re-terminal`) and you have to override only some of the styles, you can do this easily by adding `static/style.css` in your root directory and point things you want to change.

Thanks to the native CSS variables migration, you can easily customize colors without touching the theme files. Just override the CSS variables in your `static/style.css`:

```css
:root {
  --accent: #FF6B35; /* Change accent color */
  --background: #1a1a1a; /* Change background */
  --color: #f0f0f0; /* Change text color */
}
```

If you have the theme files in the theme directory, then you can directly edit anything in the theme, you just have to go to `themes/re-terminal` and modify the files. No compilation step needed.

## Found a bug? `<a id="bug" />`

If you spot any bugs, please use [Issue Tracker](https://github.com/mirus-ua/hugo-theme-re-terminal/issues) or create a new [Pull Request](https://github.com/mirus-ua/hugo-theme-re-terminal/pulls) to fix the issue.

## New cool idea or feature? `<a id="feature" />`

The theme is in constant development since 2019 and has got many cool features that helped many of you and made the theme better. But there were also many features that I wasn't sure about because I want to keep the theme as simple as possible.

So, let's say you have an idea of how to extend the theme. That's cool and you're welcome to do that, just follow these steps:

- fork the theme
- implement the feature
- write an instruction how to use the feature
- give a working example of the implementation for other users
- add info about your work to `COMMUNITY-FEATURES.md`
- make a PR with edited `COMMUNITY-FEATURES.md`

This will help keeping the theme close to its roots, and also allow anyone who wishes to improve it and match their needs, to do whatever they want.

Sounds OK? Cool, let's rock! 🤘
